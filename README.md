# Portfolio

My portfolio website is a central hub where you can explore:

1.) Featured Projects: Dive into the projects I’ve built using C++, Python, React.js, Machine Learning models, and IoT concepts.

2.) Tech Stack: A detailed list of technologies and tools I work with, including Frontend & Backend frameworks, Cloud services, and AI/ML libraries.

3.) Resume: View or download my latest resume directly from the site.

4.) Contact Section: Easily get in touch with me through a sleek contact form or find links to my socials (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).

5.) Responsive Design: The site is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes, built using modern web development practices.

This website is not just a static page—it's a living portfolio that evolves as I grow and work on new challenges.
